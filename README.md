> **"Data-Driven Foresight for the Pre-Seed Stage."**

## 📖 Executive Summary
Each year, over **11,300 funded startups fail** due to a lack of product-market fit and financial foresight. Founders often rely on intuition rather than data because high-fidelity financial modeling is expensive and complex.

**Prod-IQ** is an autonomous AI Consultant designed to bridge this gap. Unlike generic LLMs that hallucinate numbers, Prod-IQ acts as an orchestration layer—combining the conversational reasoning of **Llama-3** with the deterministic precision of **5 specialized Machine Learning models** via the **Model Context Protocol (MCP)**.

It converts unstructured chat inputs into structured financial forecasts, predicting revenue, burn rate, and survival probability with institutional-grade accuracy.

---

## 🏗 System Architecture

The system does not rely on a single model. It operates as a **Compound AI System** utilizing a Controller-Worker architecture.

### 1. The Controller (Llama-3 Agent)
* **Role:** The Reasoning Engine & Orchestrator.
* **Function:** Parses natural language user inputs (e.g., *"I want to build a food delivery app in Coimbatore with 5 riders"*).
* **Protocol:** Uses **MCP (Model Context Protocol)** to interface with external tools. It does *not* do math; it delegates math to the ML engine.

### 2. The Proprietary Data Engine (The Core IP)
* **Dataset:** Built on a custom-engineered dataset of **42,500 samples**, curated specifically for early-stage startup metrics across 15 verticals.
* **Feature Reconstruction:** Includes a custom pipeline that expands minimal user input into **387 structured features** using domain-specific benchmarks.
* *Example:* User gives `Location` + `Industry` -> Engine infers `Avg_CAC`, `Market_Saturation`, and `Labor_Costs` based on historical data.

### 3. The Expert Worker Nodes (The 5 ML Models)
The Controller dispatches structured vectors to five specialized regression and classification models:
1. **Revenue Predictor:** Forecasts ARR/MRR growth curves for Years 1-3.
2. **Survival Classifier:** Uses Kaplan-Meier logic to predict the probability of survival > 24 months.
3. **Burn Rate Estimator:** Calculates operational expenditure based on team size and tech stack.
4. **Break-Even Calculator:** Solves for the timeline to profitability.
5. **Market Sentiment Analyzer:** (RAG-based) Retrieves real-time sentiment from vector storage.

---

## ⚙️ Technical Methodology

### Feature Engineering & Data Imputation
Standard imputation (mean/median) fails in financial modeling. Prod-IQ utilizes a **Context-Aware Imputation Library** (Custom C++ optimized extension).
* **Logic:** Outliers are not dropped; they are contextualized. A high burn rate is "normal" for DeepTech but "fatal" for E-commerce. The engine adjusts missing values dynamically based on Industry Clusters.

### Orchestration & MLOps
* **Pipeline Management:** **Apache Airflow** manages the DAGs (Directed Acyclic Graphs) for data retraining and batch inference.
* **Vector Search:** **ChromaDB/Pinecone** stores millions of startup post-mortems and success stories. The Llama-3 agent uses RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) to cite *similar case studies* alongside the numerical predictions.

# Prod-IQ: Vertical AI Agent for Pre-Seed Startup Validation



[1][2]

> **“Data-Driven Foresight for the Pre-Seed Stage.”**

Prod‑IQ is a **vertical AI agent for early-stage founders**. It behaves like a **startup doctor**: a chat-based consultant that analyzes your idea, numbers, and context, then returns **hard, model-backed answers** about revenue, survival, traction, and break-even—backed by a proprietary dataset of ~42.5k real products and 5 specialized ML models.

Unlike generic LLMs that “sound smart but hallucinate numbers”, Prod‑IQ **never trusts the LLM for math**. The LLM is only the *controller*; deterministic ML models and benchmark databases actually compute the numbers.

***

## 📖 Executive Summary

As of 2025, over **11,300 funded startups have shut down in a single year**, with thousands more in India alone by October. Many fail not because the founders are lazy, but because:[3][4]

- They **don’t know if their numbers are realistic**.
- Financial modeling is **too complex or too expensive**.
- They get advice that is **vague (“focus on product‑market fit”) and not quantitative**.

**Prod‑IQ** is designed to be:

- A **pre-seed validation copilot** that sits between “idea” and “first institutional cheque”.
- A **compound AI system** that:
- Accepts **natural language** from founders.
- Converts it into **387 structured features**.
- Runs **5 honest ML models** trained on **42,500+ real products**.
- Cross‑validates with **SQL benchmarks** and **RAG over 8 CSV knowledge sources**.
- Responds in **clear, narrative, human‑friendly language**, but grounded in numbers.

The MVP is a **beta demonstrator** (like an early ChatGPT-style launch), not the full ERP‑scale product you plan for later.

***

## 🎯 MVP Scope (What This Version Does)

The current MVP focuses on:

1. **Pre‑seed / early‑stage startup analysis**, not full ERP.
2. **5 core questions**, each backed by a dedicated model:
- Will my startup likely succeed?
- What revenue can I realistically expect?
- How long can this survive?
- When might I break even?
- How fast can I reach initial traction?
3. **Session-based, no accounts yet**:
- Context preserved within a chat session.
- MVP is for testing with friendly users / recruiters / mentors.
4. **LLM-Orchestrated, Tool-Driven**:
- Llama‑3.2B (4‑bit quantized) as the brain.
- MCP server as the tool gateway.
- ML models + DBs + RAG as the “muscles”.

The future **ERP model** (multi-tenant, full analytics suite, alerting, internal team workspace, etc.) is explicitly **out of scope for this MVP**.

***

## 🧠 Core Concept: Controller–Worker Compound AI

Prod‑IQ is designed as a **Compound AI System** with a clear separation of responsibilities:[5][6][7]

### 1. Controller – Llama‑3 Agent

**Folder:** `llm/`
**Key files:** `orchestrator.py`, `router.py`, `extractor.py`, `mcp_bridge.py`, `mcp_client.py`, `local_inference.py`

**Role:**
The Controller is the **reasoning engine and traffic cop**. It:

- Reads chat messages:
- Example:
*“I’m building a subscription fitness app for Indian Tier‑2 cities, 3 founders, 6 team members, thinking of ₹499/month. What revenue and survival odds?”*
- Extracts structured fields via prompt‑guided extraction + examples:
- `main_category`, `product_type`, `team_size`, `price`, `country`, `funding`, etc.
- Decides which tools to call:
- One or several of the 5 ML models (via MCP tools).
- SQL benchmark queries.
- Vector DB search (Chroma).
- Special tools like **StoryWeaver** (narrative scenarios) and **Competitor Analysis**.
- Cross-validates:
- Compares model predictions against:
- Category averages (from SQL benchmarks).
- Similar products (from Chroma-based RAG).
- Adjusts messaging if something looks unrealistic (“this is outside typical range, here’s why…”).

**Important:** The Controller **never does the numeric prediction itself**. It delegates to the ML core and DBs, then interprets.

***

### 2. Proprietary Data Engine & Feature Reconstruction

**Folders:**
- `data/raw/`, `data/processed/`
- `ml_core/` (feature pipeline + artifacts)

**Dataset:**

- ~**42,500 real product/startup rows** across multiple verticals:
- Digital apps, SaaS, consumables, food, B2B, etc.
- ~**387 engineered features**, including:
- Raw: `price`, `rating_avg`, `review_count`, `downloads`, `active_users`, `team_size`, `total_funding`, `launch_date`, etc.
- Derived:
- `survival_score`, `growth_score`, `market_fit_score`, `risk_score`.
- Category benchmarks: `category_success_rate`, `category_avg_price`, `category_product_count`.
- Financial metrics: `burn_rate_monthly_est`, `estimated_runway_months`, `funding_per_employee`, `monthly_profit_est`.
- Quality/engagement: `engagement_score`, `rating_weighted`, `reviews_per_month`, `downloads_per_month`.
- Flags and encodings:
- `is_bootstrapped`, `is_well_funded`, `is_crowded_market`, `is_highly_rated`.
- Encoders: `category_encoded`, `product_type_encoded`, `business_model_encoded`, `source_encoded`.

**Feature Reconstruction Challenge:**
Users give you ~10–20 inputs in messy language. Your pipeline must reconstruct a **387-feature vector** with:

- Direct mappings (e.g., `price`, `team_size`).
- Derived fields (e.g., `burn_rate_monthly_est`, `estimated_runway_months`).
- Category benchmarks (from `category_benchmarks.json`).
- Text features (TF‑IDF for description, success/failure reasons).
- Encodings & flags.
- Safe defaults (no information leakage from training).

**Implementation (in `ml_core/`):**

- `input_adapter.py`:
- Maps extracted fields from LLM into a base row.
- `preprocessing.py` / `feature_engine.py` / `normalizer.py` / `pipeline.py`:
- Derives time features (`age_months`, `is_young`, `is_established`).
- Derives funding & team features:
- `burn_rate_monthly_est = team_size * k + c`
- `estimated_runway_months = total_funding / burn_rate`
- Merges category-level stats from:
- `category_benchmarks.json`
- `competitor_dominance.json`
- Builds traction metrics:
- `downloads_per_month`, `reviews_per_month`, `upvotes_per_month`.
- Text embeddings:
- `desc_tfidf.pkl`, `sf_tfidf.pkl`, `fr_tfidf.pkl`, `sr_tfidf.pkl`.
- Encodings:
- Label encoders in `artifacts/label_encoders/`.
- Fills missing columns with 0 or median; sets flags like `has_brand`, `has_website_url`, `info_completeness`.

**Role:**
This engine **turns partial user reality into the exact feature space** the models were trained on, without cheating or leaking labels.

***

### 3. Expert Worker Nodes – The 5 ML Models

**Folder:** `models/` and `ml_core/inference.py`

Each core question is backed by a dedicated model (often a stack of CatBoost + XGBoost, with separate configs and feature lists):

| Model | Target | Train Shape | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Revenue Estimator** | `revenue_estimated` | (35674, 180) | CatBoost + XGBoost, R² ≈ 0.63 |
| **Survival Predictor** | `target_survival_months` | (35674, 207) | Stack model + XGB + Cat |
| **Break-Even Time** | `target_breakeven_time` | (34612, 188) | Stack model ensemble |
| **Traction Time** | `target_traction_time` | (35520, 191) | Months to reach key traction |
| **Success Classifier** | `success_label` (−1/0/1) | (3708, 15) | 73% accuracy after leakage removal |

**Example questions they answer:**

- **Success Predictor:**
“Will my startup succeed or fail?”
→ Success probability + key risk factors.

- **Revenue Estimator:**
“What revenue can I expect?”
→ Monthly revenue estimate ± confidence.

- **Survival Predictor:**
“How long will this last with my burn and funding?”
→ Expected survival months.

- **Traction Time:**
“How fast will I get traction?” (e.g., 1,000 active users)
→ Months to traction.

- **Break-Even Time:**
“When will I be profitable?”
→ Months to break-even.

All models are trained on real, scraped data with **leakage carefully removed**, and stored with:

- Model binaries (`*.pkl`).
- `feature_names.pkl` for each model to strictly control inputs.

**Role:**
They provide **honest numeric estimates**, and are only called through a controlled inference pipeline (no direct ad-hoc queries from the LLM).

***

### 4. Knowledge & Benchmarks: SQL + Vector DB

**SQL Benchmarks (Structured)**

**Folder:** `database/`, `scripts/load_benchmark_db.py`, `scripts/setup_mysql_db.py`

- A relational store (e.g., MySQL/Postgres) built from the master CSV used to train the 5 models.
- Provides:
- Category averages: `category_success_rate`, `category_avg_funding`, `category_avg_revenue`.
- Market density: `category_product_count`, `market_saturation`, `competition_level`.
- Benchmarks for pricing, ratings, traction by category & region.

**Vector DB (Unstructured / RAG)**

**Folder:** `database/chroma_db_storage/`, scripts: `setup_chromadb.py`, `rebuild_chromadb_with_embeddings.py`, `diagnose_chroma_collections.py`, etc.

- Uses **ChromaDB** as an embedded vector DB for:
- ~8 CSV files of case studies, post‑mortems, success stories, strategic patterns.
- Accessed via:
- `hybrid_search.py`, `vector_search.py`, `vector_search_text_based.py`, `unified_backend.py`, `backend_executor.py`.
- The LLM uses RAG to:
- Retrieve similar companies.
- Borrow phrasing and logic from historical examples.
- Support features like **Competitor Analysis** and **StoryWeaver**.

**Role:**
These layers provide **grounding and benchmarks** for the LLM:
Predictions are not in isolation—they’re compared to similar products and markets.

***

### 5. MCP Server – Tool Interface Layer

**Folder:** `mcp_server/`

- **`server.py` + `config.json`**
- MCP server exposing tools to the LLM.
- **Tools (`mcp_server/tools/`)**:
- `predict_revenue.py`
- `predict_survival.py`
- `predict_breakeven.py`
- `predict_traction.py`
- `predict_success.py`
- `journey_simulator.py`
- `market_scout.py`
- **Schemas (`mcp_server/schemas/`)**:
- `startup_input.json` – normalized JSON payload from the LLM.
- `prediction_output.json` – structured result for the LLM to interpret.

**Workflow:**[7][5]

1. LLM decides: “Need revenue + survival + traction.”
2. It composes a `startup_input` payload.
3. Calls tools via MCP.
4. MCP server:
- Uses `ml_core` to reconstruct features.
- Runs the relevant models.
- Returns structured JSON: predictions + metadata.
5. LLM reads the JSON and responds in natural language.

**Role:**
MCP is the **formal contract** between “words world” (LLM) and “numbers world” (ML + DB).

***

### 6. API & Frontend Integration

**API:** `api/app.py`, `api/routes.py`

- Exposes HTTP endpoints:
- `POST /chat` – main chat endpoint.
- `POST /tools/storyweaver` – manual trigger (optional).
- `POST /tools/competitor-analysis` – manual trigger (optional).
- Connects frontend, LLM orchestrator, and session store.

**Frontend:** (in progress)

- Chat UI with:
- Message history (stored as JSON for context).
- Toggle buttons (like ChatGPT’s “modes”):
- **StoryWeaver**: scenario storytelling + visualized outcome.
- **Competitor Analysis**: multi-company benchmark tables.
- Session‑based, no login/accounts in MVP:
- Good enough to demo to recruiters and beta users.
- Full auth/workspaces planned for v2.

***

### 7. MLOps & Automation

**Planned / partial in MVP:**

- **Airflow DAGs:**[8][9]
- Weekly retraining of ML models using newly collected user data.
- Drift detection:
- Automated test calls with synthetic/baseline inputs.
- Compare predictions vs training distribution.
- Scheduled ingestion of fresh web data into:
- Raw SQL tables.
- Chroma collections.

- **Deployment:**
- GCP free tier + Docker.
- Single-node setup for demo:
- API + LLM + MCP + DB on one instance (for MVP).

**Role:**
This MLOps layer ties everything into a **living system**, not a static offline model.

***

## 🧩 Special Tools: StoryWeaver & Competitor Analysis

These are **vertical “modes”** on top of the core system.

### 1. StoryWeaver (Name Suggestion: **StoryWeaver** or **Scenario Studio**)

**Goal:** Explain complex metrics as a story, from multiple points of view.

**Flow:**

1. User:
> “My product is X, customers are saying Y, I plan to change strategy to Z. What will happen?”

2. LLM:
- Extracts: current metrics + planned strategy.
- Calls underlying models:
- New revenue prediction.
- New survival/traction projections.
- Uses RAG to retrieve similar strategy changes from history.
3. Output:
- A **story-style narrative**:
- Founder POV: how numbers translate into runway & stress.
- Market POV: how the market might react.
- Investor POV: how this strategy affects fundability.
- Optionally references dashboard visuals (future: embed chart calls).

**Role:**
Make analytics **emotionally understandable** for non-technical founders.

***

### 2. Competitor Analysis

**Goal:** Show the founder where they sit among similar companies.

**Input:**

- Triggered as a separate tool (e.g., button in UI).
- Asks user:
- Region: `regional / national / global`.
- Product type: `SaaS / digital app / consumable / food / B2B / etc.`.
- Comparison context: `valuation / revenue / product reach / customer retention`.

**Flow:**

1. LLM builds a structured query.
2. Backend uses:
- SQL benchmarks to filter 42k products by:
- Category, valuation band, funding stage, etc.
- Optionally vector search for “similar narrative” companies.
3. Returns:
- A comparison table like:

| Company | Valuation | Revenue | Team | Break-Even | Traction Time |
|--------------|-----------|---------|------|------------|---------------|
| CompanyX | $25M | $150K | 15 | 24 mo | 8 mo |
| CompanyY | $18M | $80K | 8 | 30 mo | 12 mo |
| **YOU** | ~$22M | ~$35K | 3 | ~26 mo | ~9 mo |

Plus insights:
- “Your break-even time is faster than 65% of similar startups…”
- “Your team is leaner than most; consider raising $X to match growth patterns…”

**Role:**
Ground the founder in **relative reality**, not just absolute numbers.

***

## 🔎 End-to-End Request Flow (MVP)

1. **User types in chat:**
- “We’re building an organic kids clothing brand, 2-person team, ₹4.8L burn, 180 orders/month at ₹1,899. How bad is this, and how fast can we fix it?”

2. **Frontend sends to API**
`POST /chat` with session ID and message history.

3. **API → LLM Orchestrator**
- LLM:
- Extracts:
- `main_category="kids_products"`, `price=1899`, `team_size=2`, `burn_rate=480000`, etc.
- Calls MCP tools:
- `predict_revenue`, `predict_survival`, `predict_traction`, `predict_breakeven`, `predict_success`.
- Calls DB/RAG:
- Fetch similar “organic kids clothing” products.
- Fetch category benchmarks.

4. **MCP Tools → ML Core + Databases**
- `ml_core` builds 387-feature vector.
- Models run and return predictions.
- SQL + Chroma provide benchmarks and similar cases.

5. **MCP → LLM**
- Receives structured JSON with:
- Predictions.
- Benchmarks.
- Metadata (confidence, where the sample lies in distribution).

6. **LLM crafts answer**
- Explains:
- Profitability issues.
- Runway & survival risk.
- Strategy suggestions (e.g., change AOV, switch to subscription).
- Optionally uses:
- **StoryWeaver** for narrative.
- **Competitor Analysis** to show comparative table.

7. **API returns to frontend**
- Chat UI shows narrative + numbers + optional table/visuals.
